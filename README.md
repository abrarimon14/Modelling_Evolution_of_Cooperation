# Modelling_Evolution_of_Cooperation (Object Oriented Programming)

  - Created Python classes, and subclasses to define different players, their strategies, and
    the rules of the interactions, which is based on the game, Infinite Prisoner’s Dilemma.
  - Created structures with lists and dictionaries that each player can use to get information
    about their opponents’ past actions.
  - Defined functions to simulate thousands of interactions between players. In this
    simulation, the players that win more will leave more copies of themselves in the next
    generation, similar to biological evolution.
  - Defined functions to report different metrics regarding a simulation, which is to be used for testing.
